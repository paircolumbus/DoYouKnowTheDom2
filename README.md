For this challenge, time yourself and see how quickly you can develop a solution where the `index.html` mimics the image above. __NOTE:__ You should only have to edit the `main.css` file

##Extra Credit
Rewrite and complete this challenge from scratch in both HAML & Sass. Submit a branch with both the precompiled `.haml` & `.sass` and their html/css files.
